Problem Statement :
Gone are the days when recruiters used to manually screen resumes for a long time. Sifting through thousands of candidates' resumes for a job is no more a challenging task- all thanks to resume parsers. Resume parsers use machine learning technology to help recruiters search thousands of resumes in an intelligent manner so they can screen the right candidate for a job interview. In this data science project, you will build an NLP algorithm that parses a resume and looks for the words (skills) mentioned in the job description. You will use the Phrase Matcher feature of the NLP library Spacy that does "word/phrase" matching for the resume documents. The resume parser then counts the occurrence of words (skills) under various categories for each resume that helps recruiters screen ideal candidates for a job.


Steps performed in this project are :

•	Understanding the problem statement
•	Analysing the dataset
•	Performing TextMining namely removing punctuations, Tokenization, Pos-tagging, Removing Stopwords , Lemmatization, Finding Noun phrases & verbs in the given data
•	And filtering the resumes which have more number of matching phrases
•	Finding key conclusions based on model performance
